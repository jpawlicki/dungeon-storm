==== Ideas:

- Sword but move-to-occupy (need to check Control, etc to make sure it won't trigger)
- Sword vs all adjacent (including allies)

--- Reactions:
- When this !FRIEND !RETREATs, all adjacent !ENEMIES lose a diamond. (need to check order that this fires in)
- Gain diamond when retreating
- Attack threatened enemies when retreating
- Gain 4 diamonds when first frightened
