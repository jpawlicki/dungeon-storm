Short Term:
 - unit card needs indicator of how many AP remain
 - end turn should flash when all AP on non-defeated units exhausted
 - warning about ending turn early
 - hotkey support
 - bloodied units need a visual indicator and should change stats
 - strength pips need to adjust based on unit strength changes (and should use getStrength to account for bloodied status)


Long Term:
 - AI units should take a turn
 - Load rooms from room file / database
 - Room clear / debriefing
 - Room feedback
 - Load units from database
 - Help UI
 - Abandon run UI
 - Persistence
 - Crash handling report to server logging
 - Bug report UI
