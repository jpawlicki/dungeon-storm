Campaign design:
 - A player has a pool of characters that can begin a run. They may run with up to 4.
 - Characters bond by running together. When characters retire at the end of a run, each most strongly-bonded pair raises a child (of a random unlocked class) who enters the pool.
 - The pool is then filled up to 8 with random characters drawn from unlocked classes.
