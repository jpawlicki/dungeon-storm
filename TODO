Multiplayer:
 - Goals:
   - A means for two friends to take their characters head-to-head.
	 - Easy connectivity.
	 - Session recovery.
	 - Rewards. (Potentially, could wager resources or characters, and gain some free XP / unlocks.)
 - Non-Goals:
   - Cheat-proof multiplayer is a non-goal. Players should play with friends they trust.
   - Matchmaking is a non-goal. Players should play with friends they trust.
   - In-game chat / audio is a non-goal. Players can use an external service for communication.
 - The clients must agree on a random seed.
 - The clients must agree on a map and who is which player.
 - The clients must agree on a wager (if any).
 - The clients must agree on a team experience budget.
 - Design:
	 - Server implements a simple COMET-style shared JSON object, opaque to the server.
	 - Clients connect and view a lobby screen. The lobby screen is roughly:

   - Once both sides accept, they load the map and character sets.
	 - Which player goes first is randomly chosen. On the first turn, that player only gets 1♦.
	 - Each (clickOnTile, turn end, undo) is put into the shared object, and shown on both clients.
