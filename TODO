Short Term:
 - Retirement
 - learning abilities should get more expensive every ability learned
 - sfx sound

Long Term:
 - Flee room UI
 - Persistence
 - Crash handling report to server logging
 - Bug report UI
 - Graphics: improve bloodied overlay & portrait sphere to look more 3D and marbleish
 - Room features (fire, sand, water, rock, gold, action-bonus, etc)
 - Portrait randomization
 - Tutorial popups
 - Tools
   - Room Editor
   - Adventure Editor
     - Players should be able to add rooms into a dungeon to create a custom campaign.
  	 - Some rooms should be able to be randomized.

Campaign design:
 - A player has a pool of characters that can begin a run. They may run with up to 4.
 - Characters bond by running together. When characters retire at the end of a run, each most strongly-bonded pair raises a child (of a random unlocked class) who enters the pool.
 - The pool is then filled up to 8 with random characters drawn from unlocked classes.
